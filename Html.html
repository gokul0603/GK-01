        <h1 class="head">Analog Computer</h1>
        <p>
            These computers were specifically designed to process analogue data. For readers who are not familiar with
            the term, analogue data is a type of continuous data that continually changes and does not have discrete
            values.

            It can also be said that analogue computers are used when the users are not familiar with the exact values
            like temperature, speed, current, and pressure. An intriguing feature of analogue computers is accepting the
            measuring device's data without converting it into relevant codes and numbers.

            This feature allows analogue computers to measure continuous changes in physical quantity. In most cases,
            the output of these computers is read on a dial or scale. Some examples of analogue computers are the
            mercury thermometer and speedometer.

        <h1 class="head">Digital Computer</h1>
        <p>
            Digital computers were invented to perform different calculations and logical operations at a very high
            speed. These computers accept the raw data as input, done in binary numbers (0 and 1) or digitals.

            After that, the device processes the information with programs that are already stored in the device's
            memory. This process is followed to generate the output. Some examples of digital computers include laptops,
            desktops, and other electronic devices like smartphones.

        <h1 class="head">Hybrid Computer</h1>
        <p>
            Hybrid computers are devices that have features of both digital and analog computers. These devices are
            similar in speed to analog computers and are identical to digital computers in their memory and accuracy.

            Hybrid computers can process both discrete and continuous data. These devices work by accepting analog
            signals and converting those signals into a digital form before processing. This is why these devices are
            popularly used in specialized applications where both analog and digital data has to be processed.
